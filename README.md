# Rules Engine UI - Proof of Concept

## Overview

This is a proof of concept for a custom user interface using Angular to validate the feasibility of the proposed UI design and architecture for a rules engine workflow. The application demonstrates key UI interactions relevant to rules engine management through a user list interface with popup dialogs.

## Features Implemented

### 1. User Management Interface
- **User List Display**: Shows a table with user information including:
  - First Name
  - Last Name
  - Email
  - Phone Number
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly layout that adapts to different screen sizes
- **Modern Styling**: Professional appearance with gradients, shadows, and hover effects

### 2. Popup Dialog Component (Shared Library)
- **Reusable Component**: Built as a shared component that can be used throughout the application
- **Modal Interface**: Displays detailed user information in an overlay
- **User Interaction**: 
  - Click outside to close
  - Close button functionality
  - Keyboard accessibility
- **Dynamic Content**: Displays user details passed as input properties

### 3. Mock Data Service
- **User Service**: Provides mock data for development and testing
- **Observable Pattern**: Uses RxJS Observables for data management
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to easily integrate with real APIs

### 4. Component Architecture
- **Modular Design**: Components are organized in logical folders
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each component has specific responsibilities
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation with interfaces
- **Angular Best Practices**: Follows Angular style guide and conventions

├── app/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── user-list/          # Main user list component
│   ├── shared/
│   │   └── popup-dialog/       # Reusable popup dialog component
│   ├── models/

│   └── app.config.ts           # App configuration
└── styles.css                  # Global styles
```

## Key UI Interactions

### 1. User List View
- Displays users in a clean, organized table format
- Hover effects for better user experience
- "View Details" button for each user

### 2. Popup Dialog Interaction
- Click "View Details" button to open popup
- View complete user information in modal
- Close dialog by clicking close button or outside the modal
- Smooth animations and transitions

### 3. Responsive Behavior
- Table adapts to smaller screens
- Mobile-optimized popup dialogs
- Touch-friendly interface elements

## Technologies Used

- **Angular 18**: Modern Angular framework with standalone components
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better development experience
- **RxJS**: For reactive programming and data management
- **CSS3**: Modern styling with flexbox and grid layouts
- **HTML5**: Semantic markup for accessibility

## Running the Application

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start Development Server**:
   ```bash
   ng serve
   ```

3. **Open Browser**:
   Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`

## Development Workflow

1. The application loads with mock user data
2. Users are displayed in a responsive table format
3. Clicking "View Details" opens a popup with complete user information
4. The popup can be closed by clicking the close button or clicking outside
5. All interactions are smooth and provide visual feedback

## Validation Results

✅ **Component Architecture**: Successfully implemented modular components
✅ **Shared Library**: Popup dialog component is reusable across the application
✅ **Data Integration**: Mock data service demonstrates API integration patterns
✅ **UI Interactions**: All key interactions work as expected
✅ **Responsive Design**: Interface adapts to different screen sizes
✅ **Professional Styling**: Modern, clean appearance suitable for enterprise use

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with real backend APIs
- Form components for data entry
- Advanced filtering and sorting
- Pagination for large datasets
- Advanced animation effects
- Dark mode support
- Internationalization (i18n)
- Unit and integration tests

## Conclusion

This proof of concept successfully demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed UI design and architecture. The Angular framework provides excellent support for building modular, scalable user interfaces that can handle complex rules engine workflows. The component-based architecture ensures maintainability and reusability across the application.

*This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 20.3.4.*

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
